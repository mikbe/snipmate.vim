# MikBe's Snippet Combo-Pack

My combination of a few versions and most importantly includes a
through RSpec, not the weak 4 or 5 commands in other snippets

I did not create any of these I just compiled them and cleaned up the
RSpec one slightly.

Quickly install with:

    git clone git://github.com/mikbe/snipmate.vim.git
  	cd snipmate.vim
    cp -R * ~/.vim
